# TriviaGame


Trivia game should work (it doesn't).

The game objective is to answer the questions after clicking the start button to begin the timer.  As the timer counts down to 0,
each answer should be recorded, and matched against the correct answer.  If the correct answer matches the user answer, the correct Count is increased by 1, else, the incorrect Count is increased by 1.

The score is recorded based on each correct count.  There are 10 questions, worth 10% each.  

Once the user selects an answer, they shall click the next button to display the next question.  

I've got the clock (set to 10 for testing) working and the 'next' to get the next question.  I refactored all of it and now it's not taking the value of the first question.
